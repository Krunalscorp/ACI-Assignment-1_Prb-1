1. Since each node has to be visited, what is the point of A* algorithm?
2. One approach could be that to go to the next node from a starting point based on evaluating f(n) = g(n) + h(n). But here we might end up at a node before exit so from that node all connecting nodes are already visited and it's a dead end.
3. I have used Manhatten Heuristic values. But we can employ other as well. Not entirely sure how to assign coordinates to nodes for calculating the distance.
4. Approach-1 file is producing the optimal path without visiting all the nodes
